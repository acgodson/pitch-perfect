Pitch Perfect is a voice-controlled AI assistant for Ethereum wallet management. Using the wake phrase **"Hey Beca, listen up,"** users can securely manage their wallets with natural voice commands. The system requires speaker identification before processing any wallet actions, improving trust, UX and personalization.

Key features include:

- **Voice-activated wallet management** with mandatory speaker identification
- **Wake phrase**: "Hey Beca, listen up"
- **Frontend-driven voice registration** for secure profile creation
- **Transcription and command processing** via LLM and ElizaOS Agent
- **Conversation memory** for contextual

## üîó Plugin Orchestration Flow

1. **Voice Registration**  
   - User registers voice via frontend.
   - Voice plugin processes registration and, on success, agent triggers wallet creation via wallet plugin.
   - Wallet address is attached to the user profile.

2. **Speaker Identification**  
   - On every new session or sensitive command, agent requires speaker identification via the voice plugin.

3. **Wallet Actions**  
   - After identification, user can request wallet info, insights or intiate transactions.
   - For EVM transactions, wallet and uses Privy API to send on any supported chain (via CAIP2 chain ID) and ccip plugin and pitch-perfect contract forward assets to other chains

4. **Cross-Chain (CCIP) Actions**  
   - For cross-chain requests, CCIP plugin prepares the transaction to be routed via the pitch-perfect `sender contract`.
   - After user confirmation, wallet plugin sends the transaction.
